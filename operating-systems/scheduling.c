 * This program implements FCFS and SJF scheduling
 * algorithms in C and calculates the average waiting
 * time and average turnaround time of concurrent processes.
 *
 * It expects a text file and scheduling algorithm (FCFS or SJF)
 * as arguments. Inputs are the number of processes, arrival time,
 * and burst time. Outputs are the order of process execution,
 * average waiting time, and average turn around time.
